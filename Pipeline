The following steps are detailed for the pipeline:
Step 1: Placental gene sets were gathered from databases and literature, and the correlation between genes was calculated using STRINGdb. Subsequently, the placental gene network was constructed.
STRINGdb is a tool utilized for retrieving gene/protein interactions, offering information on interactions between genes and proteins. It facilitates the construction of gene networks and the calculation of gene correlations. In this study, the process of calculating gene correlations typically involves the following steps:
(1) Organizing the gene list: The collected placental gene sets were organized into a list.
(2) Retrieving interaction data: Interaction data among genes were obtained from the STRING database using the string_db() function of STRINGdb. The organized list of placental genes served as the input to extract interaction information among these genes.
(3) Constructing the gene network: The interaction data were transformed into a gene network, where genes served as nodes and interactions as edges. Genes with interactions were connected, facilitating the formation of a gene network.
(4) Calculating gene correlation: Within the constructed gene network, a similarity calculation method based on shared neighbors was utilized to determine the correlations among genes. Specifically, two genes were considered to have a high correlation if they interacted with one or more other genes. In this study, the number of shared neighbors served as the metric for measuring correlation. The correlation between two genes was converted into a correlation score based on the number of shared neighbors. Thus, a greater number of shared neighbors indicated a stronger correlation between the genes, resulting in a higher correlation coefficient.
(5) Setting the threshold: By setting the correlation coefficient threshold at 0.6, genes with significant correlation were screened. This process ensured the stability of the placental gene network.

Step 2: Data on chemicals were collected and organized into training, validation, and prediction sets, respectively. The details are as follows:
(1) Training set (307 compounds): Experimental data on compounds related to placental were collated from the literature, including the F/M ratio, CI value. Subsequently, compounds were labeled as those that cannot cross the placental barrier (NC) and those that can (C).
(2) Validation set (18 compounds): Eighteen compounds, definitively characterized in the literature as C or NC, were selected for the validation set.
(3) Prediction Set (259 compounds): A total of 259 compounds were collected from the DEDuCT database (https://cb.imsc.res.in/deduct/) and literature sources, including various chemical groups such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), and their derivatives. Whether these compounds can cross the placental barrier has not been defined.

Step 3: The original chemical-gene interactions for 307 compounds were retrieved from the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) and Swiss Target Prediction website. Subsequently, the original chemical-gene interactions for each compound were systematically mapped onto the constructed placental gene network, thereby facilitating the identification of new chemical-gene interactions. The details are as follows:
(1) Collecting original chemical-gene interactions: The corresponding gene information for each compound, termed as original chemical-gene interactions, was downloaded from the CTD database and the Swiss Target Prediction website.
(2) Expanding original chemical-gene interactions: The original chemical-gene interactions for each compound were mapped onto the placental gene network to identify new chemical-gene interactions.
(3) Ranking the expanded genes: The expanded genes were ranked based on their weighted values within the network, which facilitated the identification of genes exhibiting the highest correlations.
(4) Identification of Top genes: The top 1,000 genes exhibiting the highest correlation were designated as TOP genes. These genes represent those most significantly impacted by disturbances when the original chemical-gene interactions are mapped onto the placental gene network.

Step 4: Placental related pathway gene sets were collected from MSigDB database. A total of 1,425 pathway gene sets were obtained after specific screening and used as the background gene set. The TOP gene for each compound served as the enrichment gene set. Finally, pathway activation scores for each compound were calculated based on the 1,425 pathway gene sets. The details are as follows:
(1) Collecting placental related pathway gene sets: Placental related pathway gene sets annotated from KEGG, REACTOME, WikiPathways, and Gene Ontology databases were obtained from the comprehensive MSigDB database.
(2) Filtering placental related gene sets: Gene sets related to placental function and interactions were retained, while those containing fewer than 20 genes or more than 200 genes were excluded to ensure placental specificity.
(3) Enrichment analysis using background gene sets: The 1,425 pathway gene sets obtained through screening were utilized as the background gene set. The TOP gene for each compound served as the enriched gene set (input file). Enrichment analysis of the TOP genes was conducted using the fgsea package in R, with the output providing standardized enrichment scores (NES) and P_val.
(4) Calculating pathway activation scores: Pathway activation scores for each compound were calculated according to eq (1).
       Score= NES*(-Log10(P_val))    eq (1)
(5)Determining pathway differences: Pathway differences between compounds that can cross the placental barrier (C) and those that cannot (NC) were determined based on the calculated pathway activation scores.

Step 5: The molecular descriptor of each compound, combined with the pathway activation score, was employed as input features for the machine learning model. Seven machine learning models, including XGBoost, Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), Naive Bayes (NB), and two ensemble models, were developed. The model demonstrating the best performance was selected to calculate a probability score for evaluating the ability of the compound to cross the placental barrier. The details are as follows:
(1) Generating molecular descriptors: The molecular descriptors of the compounds were generated using PaDEL to form the original feature set. Subsequently, the pathway activation scores corresponding to each compound were incorporated into the feature set, resulting in a total of 3,752 features.
(2) Selection of features: Descriptors with close to zero variance (standard deviation < 10-6) and highly correlated descriptors (correlation coefficient > 0.75) were eliminated. Subsequently, the Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) method was employed to further refine the input features. Finally, the nine features, including pathway and structural information of the compound, were selected as inputs for the model.
(3) Constructing the model: Seven machine learning models, namely XGBoost, Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), Naive Bayes (NB), and two ensemble models, were developed based on the nine input features. Subsequently, their prediction performance was evaluated.
(4) Calculation of probability score: The probability score for each compound's ability to cross the placental barrier was calculated utilizing the optimal XGBoost algorithm.
(5) Definition of probability score range: Compounds were categorized based on their probability scores into three ranges: high-potential (>90%), moderate-potential (80%â€“90%), and low-potential (<80%).

Step 6: The probability scores were validated using 18 compounds, which were clearly defined in the literature as either able or unable to cross the placental barrier. The details are as follows:
(1) Information was gathered from the literature on 18 compounds that were clearly defined as either able or unable to cross the placental barrier. This information included the F/M and TI values of the compounds.
(2) Molecular descriptors for the 18 compounds were calculated, followed by the repetition of step 3, step 4 (specific detailed in (3) and (4)), and step 5 (specific operations detailed in (3) and (4)). The nine input features corresponding to 18 compounds were utilized as inputs for the model to calculate the probability score of the compounds crossing the placental barrier.
(3) The accuracy of the probability scores was verified through comparison them with the information collected from the literature.

Step 7: Important chemical substructures of compounds within three potential ranges were analyzed using Canvas to identify key chemical features associated with placental exposure.

Step 8: The probability scores for environmental compounds crossing the placental barrier were calculated. The details are as follows:
(1) The 259 environmental compounds were collected from DEDuCT and the literature. However, it was not clearly defined whether these compounds can cross the placental barrier or not.
(2) Molecular descriptors were calculated for the 259 compounds, followed by the repetition of step 3, step 4 (specific detailed in (3) and (4)), and step 5 (specific detailed in (3) and (4)). The nine input features corresponding to 259 compounds were utilized as inputs to the model to calculate the probability score of the compounds crossing the placental barrier.

Step 9: The application domain of the model was characterized using the Euclidean distance method to determine the space of compounds to which the model was applicable.
